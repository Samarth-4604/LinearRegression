# 🧠 Linear Regression with Scikit-Learn

This project demonstrates how to implement **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. The dataset used is a housing dataset that includes features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.

## 📌 Objectives

- Understand and implement Linear Regression (Simple & Multiple)
- Learn how to evaluate regression models using metrics
- Visualize regression results
- Interpret model coefficients

A sample dataset with house prices and attributes like:
- `area`
- `bedrooms`
- `bathrooms`
- `furnishingstatus`
- `price` (target)
